# What is Integer-Programing?
Integer programming problem is a mathematical optimization or feasibility program in which some or all of the variables are restricted to be integers.
# Problem Statment:
max: 8x1 + 5x2
st:
x1 + x2 <=6
9x1+ 5x2 <=45
x1,x2 are integers
# Aim:
In this program, we are using Integer-Programing to find an optimized solution by maximizing two variable ( x1,x2) and two constraints.
