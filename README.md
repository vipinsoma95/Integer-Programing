# What is Integer-Programing ?
Integer programming problem is a mathematical optimization or feasibility program in which some or all of the variables are restricted to be integers.
# Problem:
In this program we are using Integer-Programing to find an optimized solution by maximizing two variable ( x1,x2) and two constraints.
